**Thai Grammatical Error Correction for L2 Learners**

This repository contains resources and code related to Thai grammatical error correction (GEC) for second language (L2) learners. The goal of this project is to build effective GEC systems tailored for the unique challenges of Thai, a low-resource and morphologically rich language.

ðŸš€ **Try the best-performing model**:  
We fine-tuned multiple large language models on a curated dataset of Thai L2 learner writing. The best model, based on mT5-large with Self-Instruct augmentation, is available on Hugging Face:

This model achieves strong performance across multiple GEC metrics and is suitable for research, educational, and assistive applications.
